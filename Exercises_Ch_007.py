# Discussion
#
# 1.  The sequences of statements ins a simple decision excecutes when
#     the condition true. If it is false, cthe statements are skipped.
#     A two-way decision is a simple decision with two parts. If the
#     condition is true, the statements are executed. If it is false,
#     a different set of statements is excecuted.
#     Multi-way decisions specifiy different conditions, which, if true,
#     lead to different sets of statements being executd.
# 2.  Exception-handling is conditional, similar to if statements. If an
#     error occurs in the body of the try statement, Python looks for an
#     except clause with a matching error and excecute the handler
#     code if an appropriate except is found.
